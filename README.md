# SVM_MODEL_CREATION

# 🧑‍💻 **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier** 🖥️

Welcome to the **SVM Classifier Project**! 🎉 This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** from scratch using Python. If you're into **machine learning**, this is the perfect place to start! 🚀

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for **classification tasks**. This SVM implementation leverages **gradient descent optimization** to update weights and biases iteratively and classify input data. The algorithm also uses **hinge loss** and **regularization** to enhance performance.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

### **Training Logic**
- **Input Features (X)**: The data points (rows) with features (columns).
- **Labels (Y)**: The target labels (binary classification: 0 or 1). We encode 0 as -1 to match SVM logic.

The algorithm minimizes **hinge loss** through **gradient descent** by adjusting:
- **Weights (w)**: Determines the hyperplane's orientation.
- **Bias (b)**: Shifts the hyperplane.

The goal is to maximize the **margin** between the data points of different classes while minimizing misclassification errors.

### **Key Hyperparameters**:
- **Learning Rate**: Controls how fast the model updates weights and bias.
- **Number of Iterations**: The number of times the algorithm runs through the dataset.
- **Lambda Parameter**: Regularization parameter to prevent overfitting.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have **Python** and the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwadhama2004/svm-classifier.git
cd svm-classifier
```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:

Ensure your dataset (`X_train.csv` and `Y_train.csv`) is present in the project folder.

3. **Run the Code**:

Use **Jupyter Notebook** or run the Python script:

```bash
jupyter notebook svm_classifier.ipynb
```

Or run it directly:

```bash
python svm_classifier.py
```

## 🏗️ **Code Breakdown**

### **Class Initialization**

The `SVM_classifier` class initializes the key hyperparameters: `learning_rate`, `no_of_iterations`, and `lambda_parameter`.

### **Training the Model**

```python
model = SVM_classifier(learning_rate=0.01, no_of_iterations=1000, lambda_parameter=0.01)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

- **fit()**: Trains the model by finding the optimal weights and bias using **gradient descent**.

### **Updating Weights**

```python
def update_weights(self):
    y_label = np.where(self.Y <= 0, -1, 1)
    ...
    self.w = self.w - self.learning_rate * dw
    self.b = self.b - self.learning_rate * db
```

- The **weights and bias** are updated iteratively to minimize misclassification.

### **Predicting New Labels**

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

- **predict()**: Classifies the input data points by calculating `w·X - b` and returning labels (0 or 1).

## 📊 **Sample Code**

Here’s a glimpse of how the code works:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Initialize the model with hyperparameters
model = SVM_classifier(learning_rate=0.001, no_of_iterations=1000, lambda_parameter=0.01)

# Fit the model with training data
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Predict the labels for the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Predicted Labels:", y_pred)
```

## 📈 **Results**

Our SVM model performs well for **binary classification tasks**, such as classifying data points into two categories. 

### **Potential Metrics to Evaluate Performance**:
- **Accuracy**: How many predictions are correct?
- **Precision & Recall**: Measure the quality of predictions for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the true positives and negatives.

---

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**

- **Support Multiclass Classification**: Extend the model for multiple classes.
- **Kernel Methods**: Implement RBF or polynomial kernels to handle non-linearly separable data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters.
- **Real-world Dataset**: Train the model on a larger, real-world dataset for practical results.
